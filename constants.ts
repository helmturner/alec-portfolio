    I'm a self-taught developer driven by my passions, which include
    learning, engineering, problem- solving, and entrepreneurship. I've
    configured LANs, provisioned servers on the edge and in the cloud,
    deployed containerized micro-services, and engineered full-stack web
    apps â€” all just for fun.

    My goal is to harness my skills to make a positive impact in

        Many mentors recommended that I build a website to show off my skills, so I took the advice.
        
        What started as a speedrun challenge ended up as a lesson: I needed to learn more about CSS.
        
        That's why this portfolio is built with minimal dependencies and 100% custom CSS.
        
        Maybe I'm still not the best designer, but given a good design, I now know how to implement it!

        In an effort to optimize my gig-economy earnings, I set out to aggregate every scrap of data I had and identify the patterns.

        This brought me to Airtable, a low-code, table-based data management platform. It didn't take long for me to realize that I could transform that data in interesting ways to unearth surprising insights... all I had to do was use a tiny bit of whatever this "JavaScript" thing was.

        I was hooked. The build-in autocomplete and readily-available API documentation made learning my first programming language fun and intuitive.
        
        Because the editor was backed by a Typescript Language server, I learned more than I even knew at the time. Mastering TypeScript was a small step away once I outgrew the sandbox and began writing code in the real world.

        Some of the first working code I wrote has been archived on GitHub.

    description: `
    Though I had mastered JavaScript by writing Airtable Apps (now called Extensions), I knew I needed a broader understanding of enterprise-grade software development tools and resources. Naturally, the next logical step was an advanced full-stack financial management application.

    The design involved leveraging Microsoft Azure's deep-learning AI model for receipts (via their 'form-recognizer' API) and the Plaid API to automatically balance and categorize expenses by matching the user's account transactions with information inferred from user-uploaded receipt images.
    
    The back-end logic was originally implemented with Next.js API routes as part of this repo, but now lives in a separate repo: alecvision/duewell-api-ts.
    
    This application is still under semi-active development and will receive updates as time permits. The current goal is to re-implement the API using GraphQL, but it's a large undertaking and free time is scarce; this project may frequently be shelved in favor of more readily attainable goals.

        Becuase the organization brings together professionals from different fields, a key goal was to make markdown the primary format for non-technical contributions.

        Because the organization is a non-profit, another key goal was to do it cheaply, or for free.

        Ultimately, my goal is to compose these plugins into a webpack loader and NextJS plugin, creating a plug-and-play solution for the missing Static Site Generation (SSG) features of NextJS.

    As of the beginning of 2022, the Code for Tulsa website had not been updated in 6 years. This repo started as an effort to modernize the core site and create a dynamic working environment that facilitates additional contributions from current and future volunteers of all backgrounds.

    When I first joined the project, the requirements were simple: create a web blog that facilitates content contributions from non-technical volunteers. Because of this, the project was initially bootstrapped with create-gatsby-app as a static website.
    
    Soon after, discussions began brewing around the idea of integrating other resources utilized by the organization, such as Twitter, Slack, Meetup, etc. It was agreed that a more flexible framework was needed to keep up with the dynamic demands of the organization.
    
    After leading the effort to conver the project to NextJS for deployment on serverless platforms, I earned the role of Lead Developer. Since then, I've been hard at work un-blocking co-contributors, improving the quality of the codebase, and progressing the site towards launch.
